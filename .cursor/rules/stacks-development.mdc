# Stacks Development Guidelines

## Wallet Integration
- Use [@stacks/connect](https://github.com/stacks-network/connect) for wallet connections
- Always handle wallet connection states properly in [hooks/wallet.ts](mdc:hooks/wallet.ts)
- Implement proper error handling for wallet operations
- Use the `useWallet` hook for all wallet-related functionality

## Authentication
- JWT tokens are used for API authentication with wallet signatures
- API endpoints follow RESTful patterns in `app/api/auth/`
- Always verify signatures before creating sessions
- Use [lib/auth/jwt.ts](mdc:lib/auth/jwt.ts) for token operations

## Database
- Use Prisma with MongoDB for data persistence
- User model in [prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma) includes wallet address and connection history
- Always use database utilities in [lib/db/user.ts](mdc:lib/db/user.ts) for user operations

## API Development
- Follow the patterns established in `app/api/auth/` for new endpoints
- Use Zod for request validation
- Implement proper error handling with consistent response formats
- Always include TypeScript types for requests and responses
