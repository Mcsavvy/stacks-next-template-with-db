- Fix all linting errors before committing

## Code Style

- Use trailing commas in objects and arrays
- Use proper TypeScript types throughout

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors properly with try-catch blocks

- Never leave console.log statements in production code

## Performance
- Use proper React patterns (useCallback, useMemo, useEffect dependencies)
- Implement proper loading states
- Use proper async/await patterns
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders

## Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, secrets)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user input
